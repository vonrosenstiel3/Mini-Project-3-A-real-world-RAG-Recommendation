# Gund Gallery RAG Docent — Mini-Project #3

A lightweight, locally deployable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system designed as an AI museum docent for **The Gund** (Gund Gallery, Kenyon College). The agent provides grounded Q&A over artworks and exhibitions, adapts tone and reading level for diverse audiences, supports multilingual explanation, and ensures factual accuracy—especially for provenance and sensitive topics.

## Features
- Grounded Q&A over museum collection and exhibitions  
- Research-style summarization of labels & didactics  
- Art-theory link explanations and thematic connections  
- Adaptive personas: child, general, student, professional, multilingual, low-vision  
- Local, low-cost RAG pipeline (embeddings, retrieval, reranking, LLM)  
- Strict citation requirements and safe handling of provenance/donor topics
